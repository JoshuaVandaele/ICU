## Changing the texture

To change the texture, you need to create a resource pack. You can do this by creating a folder in the `resourcepacks` folder in your `.minecraft` folder. Inside this folder, you need to create a folder called `assets/minecraft/textures/block` and place your texture in there. The texture should be a 16x16 png file. The name of the file should be `icu_barrier.png`.
